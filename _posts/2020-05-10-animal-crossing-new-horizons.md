How I've spent some of my time for the past weeks. The perfect past-time while practicing social distancing.

I've been a fan of the Animal Crossing series since I first played on the GameCube.
I've always loved filling my encyclopedia and museum with fish and bugs, and now with New Horizons, designing my island has become another
fun and exciting endeavour.
I still have a long way to go, but here's some of my island so far!
