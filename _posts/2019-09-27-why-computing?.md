title: Why Computing?

I learned a great deal about the software development life cycle and the teamwork that makes everything
happen through assigned group projects. I gained experience in the roles of project manager,
systems analyst, programmer, tester, and technical writer. For one of the projects, our team
attempted to recreate Battleship. We successfully implemented logic for a user’s
and AI’s turn events. This involved passing ship coordinates to a function, using a conditional
statement to check positions within a two-dimensional array. The problem solving abilities and
passion I possess allow me to create and explore various technologies with a high degree of
effectiveness.

Programming is a fulfilling discipline becasse it is essentially problem solving and creativity. I find thatThese qualities provide myself with the feeling of satisfaction as I love solving a good
problem and fulfillment as I express myself creatively. Usually, problem solving is involved with
academic subjects like chemistry or physics, and creativity is involved with artistic subjects like music
and theatre. These two qualities are often separated in the workplace and while I have a passion for
both of these worlds, this introduces me to a lot of conflict in deciding my future career. However, programming allows me to dabble in the best of both worlds. It gives me the opportunity to create programs while using logic to create structure. Therefore, computer programming would be a fulfilling and interesting career for myself.
