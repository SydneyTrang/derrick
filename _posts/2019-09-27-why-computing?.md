Programming is a fulfilling discipline becasse it is essentially problem solving and creativity. I find that these qualities are the most satisfying qualities. Nothing beats the feeling of solving a challenging problem or physically seeing the results of your hard work in a piece of art.

My programming endeavours began with group projects in highschool. I learned a great deal about the software development life cycle and the teamwork. I gained experience as a project manager, systems analyst, programmer, tester, and technical writer. For one of the projects, our team attempted to recreate Battleship. We successfully implemented logic for a user’s and AI’s turn events. This involved passing ship coordinates to a function, using a conditional statement to check positions within a two-dimensional array. The problem solving abilities and passion I possess allow me to create and explore various technologies with a high degree of effectiveness.
