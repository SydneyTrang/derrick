Nowadays, as the world becomes more reliant on technology programming has become a very necessary skill.

My programming endeavours began with group projects in high school. I learned a great deal about the software development life cycle and the teamwork required to produce a final product. I gained experience as a project manager, systems analyst, programmer, tester, and technical writer. For one of our projects, our team recreated the game Battleship in Java using the NetBeans IDE. This involved managing data in a two-dimensional array: storing ship coordinates, querying for ship positions, and updating misses and hits.
Two big lessons learned from this project:
* **Data matters** - Structuring, organizing, and managing data is crucial to the success of any project. Working in a messy environment puts a strain on your brain!

* **Teamwork really makes the dreamwork** - You hear this saying time and time again. But not until you actually work in a team, try to manage conflict, and need to meet a deadline, do you truly understand this saying.


Programming is a fulfilling discipline because it is essentially problem solving and creativity. I find that these qualities are the most satisfying qualities. Nothing beats the feeling of solving a challenging problem or seeing the results of your hard work!
