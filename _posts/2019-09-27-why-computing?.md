All jokes aside, I find programming to be very necessary skill in a world that's becoming highly reliant on technology these days.

My programming endeavours began with group projects in highschool. I learned a great deal about the software development life cycle and the teamwork required to produce a final product. I gained experience as a project manager, systems analyst, programmer, tester, and technical writer. For one of our projects, our team recreated the game Battleship in Java using the NetBeans IDE. This involved managing data in a two-dimensional array: storing ship coordinates, querying for ship positions, and updating misses and hits.

Programming is a fulfilling discipline because it is essentially problem solving and creativity. I find that these qualities are the most satisfying qualities. Nothing beats the feeling of solving a challenging problem or seeing the results of your hard work.
