Hi, my name is Sydney Trang! Currently I am pursing a bachelor's in actuarial science and computing at the University of Waterloo. I'm looking forward to learning and growing with you all!

My hobbies include learning new programming languages, drawing, solving problems, and playing the piano and saxophone. Not to mention, I love practically any game out there! (Although, I might just happen to give special attention to board games and video games.) You name it, and I'll probably have played it or want to play it.
